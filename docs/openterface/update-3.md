# From Development to Your Hands: Behind the Scenes with Openterface

Hi everyone!

Weâ€™re back with another update on our crowdfunding journey, and we've got some exciting news to share!

### Hitting a Major Milestone

First things first, weâ€™re absolutely over the moon to announce that weâ€™ve hit an astonishing [**1000% of our original funding goal**](https://www.crowdsupply.com/techxartisan/openterface-mini-kvm)! A massive thank you to each and every one of you. Your support has been nothing short of phenomenal!

### Production Planning

Weâ€™ve been super busy on the production front already! This week, we visited the tech hub of Shenzhen and had the chance to tour one of the top tech manufacturers. These folks work with big names like Meta, ABB, and Blaupunkt, and it was incredible to see their advanced production lines and quality control machinery in action. I wish I could share more photos, but hereâ€™s one with a bit of digital mosaic for confidentiality.

(We were discussing QC with the production line manager.)

Weâ€™re feeling very positive about this partnership and their enthusiasm to support a tech startup like ours. Weâ€™re committed to ensuring the manufacturing phase is handled with the utmost dedication and quality so we can get our product into your hands soon! Hereâ€™s a snapshot of our core team members at the factory entrance:

### Upgrading Toolkit Accessories

Weâ€™re always looking for ways to improve, and our add-on **VGA-to-HDMI cable** has now been upgraded to 1 metre long with enhanced quality, as you can see from our previous [Week 2 update](https://www.crowdsupply.com/techxartisan/openterface-mini-kvm/updates/our-vga-to-hdmi-cable-is-now-available-to-european-backers-and-its-a-full-meter-long).

Next up, weâ€™re also looking into our **1.5 metre long Type-C cable** for connecting to the host computer. Type-C is becoming increasingly common across new computers, laptops, and even servers. After testing many manufacturers, we found one that could produce this stylish orange Type-C cable with a lovely silicone feel that meets our quality standards.

Currently, **an extra Type-C-to-USB-A adapter is required** if our Mini-KVM works with a host computer that only has USB-A ports.

![typec-cable-need-adapter](media-u3/typec-cable-need-adapter.webp)

We know itâ€™s a bit of a hassle, so weâ€™re working closely with our manufacturer to improve it by **integrating an attached Type-C-to-USB-A adapter**. Hereâ€™s a mock-up of what it might look like.

![new-typec-cable](media-u3/upgrade-for-typ-c-cable-with-adapter.jpg)

This special Type-C cable doesnâ€™t exist on the market and requires our custom OEM production. Weâ€™re aiming to include this solution in our final toolkit package for backers, but I'm still crunching the numbers and giving my calculator a workout! To make this happen, **we need more support to reduce the overall cost of production** for our mini-KVM toolkit. Given the current crowdfunding numbers and production costs, making this custom Type-C cable is becoming more feasible, as it is approaching the break-even point. Iâ€™ll keep everyone updated in the Openterface community on any progress!

For your part, if you find our project promising and believe the Mini-KVM can make your tech life easier, please consider backing us and spreading the word to your friends. Let's ensure we can enhance the product even further while keeping it wallet-friendly for everyone in this crowdfunding campaign! Thanks a bunch!

### Open Source Updates and Global Teamwork!

Please bear with us during this early stage of development, as there are still bugs and changes happening in our host applications. Thatâ€™s where our beta team comes in! Weâ€™ve already organised **two rounds of beta testing**. Check out our posts here to learn more:

- [Update on Applications for Beta Team Round 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Openterface_miniKVM/comments/1bszggn/update_for_our_beta_test_applicants_round_1/) on Apr 1, 2024
- [Shipment to Beta Team Round 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Openterface_miniKVM/comments/1cayi8v/meet_your_new_tech_allies_soon_beta_team/) on Apr 23, 2024
- [Application for Joining Beta Team Round 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Openterface_miniKVM/comments/1cpcowl/make_your_mark_join_our_round_2_beta_testing_crew/) on May 11, 2024
- [Update on Applications for Beta Team Round 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Openterface_miniKVM/comments/1cxr3zp/update_for_our_beta_test_applicants_round_2/) on May 22, 2024

As you can see from the above posts, we received an overwhelming number of fantastic applications in Rounds 1 and 2, and it was a real challenge to narrow down the candidates from such a brilliant pool. We had to make some tough decisions due to the limited spots available at this exclusive phase!

Our beta team is great and truly international, with members from the US ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸, UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§, Japan ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ, Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª, Czech Republic ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿, Norway ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´, Belgium ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ª, France ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·, Austria ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¹, Australia ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º, Poland ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±, Netherlands ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±, China ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³, and more joining soon. These testers have development experience, real use cases for our device, and a passion for helping open-source projects like ours. Our beta team is already testing it, raising issues, and suggesting features for us to improve further.

Even though most of you donâ€™t have our devices yet, you can still review our code on GitHub and join the conversation with our beta and dev teams in [our community](https://openterface.com/community/)! Let us know what you find so we can make this device awesome together!

Here are updates on our open-source Github repo:

#### [**Openterface_MacOS**](https://github.com/TechxArtisanStudio/Openterface_MacOS)

Our Openterface MacOS host app is already officially live on the **Apple App Store**. Just search for 'Openterface' or 'mini-KVM' to find our app page. Even better, weâ€™ve uploaded the full code to our GitHub repo: Openterface_MacOS for the Mini-KVM. You can check out this [basic operation demo](https://openterface.com/basic-testing/) on **MacOS**.

![openterface-macos-app-store](media-u3/openterface-macos-app-store.jpeg)

#### [**Openterface_QT**](https://github.com/TechxArtisanStudio/Openterface_QT)

QT is a versatile framework that we love, so we built our mini-KVM based on it. For the **Windows version**, check out our early demo video [here](https://openterface.com/basic-testing/). Thereâ€™s still quite a bit of work to do, but you can see it already works great with low latency and a stable connection! You can find and download the early beta app from the github repo there.

![openterface-win-app-demo-1](media-u3/openterface-win-app-demo-1.jpg)
![openterface-win-app-demo-2](media-u3/openterface-win-app-demo-2.jpg)

As for Linux-based systems, packaging for different architectures like ARM32, ARM64, ARMv7, and ARMv8, especially for the **Raspberry Pi**, is quite a challenge (with hours and hours of waiting for packaging), but weâ€™re working on it. Expect a Linux demo soon, hopefully within a week. Additionally, weâ€™re tidying up the code for Openterface_QT and should have it on GitHub in a week or two.

####  **[Openterface_Android](https://github.com/TechxArtisanStudio/Openterface_Android) and [Openterface_WebExtension](https://github.com/TechxArtisanStudio/Openterface_WebExtension)**

Weâ€™ve completed the **proof of concept** for both Android and WebExtension. While these are lower priorities compared to macOS, Windows, and Linux, rest assured theyâ€™re in the pipeline. Based on our preliminary research, the Openterface_Android project might also support **ChromeOS**. If you have any insights, please join the discussion!

####  **Even for iPadOS?**

Weâ€™re also exploring compatibility with Appleâ€™s mobile systems, like iPadOS. Due to Appleâ€™s stringent controls, these platforms might not support wired connections with third-party devices. However, weâ€™re investigating potential workarounds, especially for iPads with M series chips. Our beta mate **Seb** has already made [some interesting findings](https://discord.com/channels/1199611503469408276/1221755356896825424/1238070985794781265) and this is worth exploring further, though nothing is confirmed yet. If you have any insights or suggestions, join our community and letâ€™s discuss!

![seb-explore-minikvm-for-ipados](media-u3/seb-explore-minikvm-for-ipados.webp)

#### [**Openterface_Mini-KVM_Hardware**](https://github.com/TechxArtisanStudio/Openterface_Mini-KVM_Hardware)

Coming soon too! We will start releasing the hardware details and code incrementally over the next two to three weeks. 

In the meantime, you can learn more about our hardware here:Â [datasheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UPw5RwGTp0AjKL3wOvQZUS1hp3IPMxkCujtqy5haeP0/edit?usp=sharing) and [How It Works](https://openterface.com/how-it-works/) for now. This page explains our USB-HDMI capture integration, featuring the **CH9329** chip for keyboard and mouse control. Technical enthusiasts may find the details on this chip particularly interesting. Additionally, our mini-KVM utilises theÂ **CH340**Â chip, supporting two built-in USB hubs for both the host and target sides. Our mini-KVM is comparable to many video capture cards currently on the market.

#### Please hang tight!

We're hard working here and in the process of **open-sourcing both our software and hardware**. Good things take time to cook! Thanks for your patience and understanding! Stay tuned and cheers!
